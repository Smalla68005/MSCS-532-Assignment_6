# MSCS-532-Assignment_6
## Overview
This assignment is designed to deepen the understanding of medians, order statistics, and elementary data
structures. It includes selection algorithms with both randomized and deterministic approach. The second part of this assignment
includes implenting various data structures. It includes:

- Array
- Linked List
- Queue
- Stack
- Rooted Tree

## Instruction on Running the program
- ### Slection Algorithm
    SelectionAlgorithms.py script includes the implementaion of Deterministic Median of Medians and Randomized Quickselect Algorithms
    - Run the SelectionAlgoriths.py script.
- ### Elementary Data Structures
    - ArrayImpl.py to run the array implementaion.
    - LinkedListImpl.py to run the Linked list implementaion.
    - QueueImpl.py to run the Queue implementation.
    - StackImpl.py to run the Stack implementaion.
    - RootedTreeImpl.py to run the RootedTree implementation.
